			<h2>The Power of Information</h2>
			<p>“Knowledge is power”, is a common phrase most people are familiar with. Throughout history, people and organizations have used their knowledge to climb to power by exploiting the world around them. The most famous exploit of knowledge was the bible. During the height of the medieval era, the pope had the power to start wars forcing countries to participate or risk being excommunicated from the church. Although times have changed, exploiting information for personal gain will always be relevant. We live in the information era where everything is documented and stored as data points. Most of the time your information is being used by companies to determine better marketing strategies or manage the overall logistics, depending on the company. Some other companies like Facebook would sell your information to make an extra buck. Hackers will then use the information to socially engineer their targets to complete their mission. However, a well-informed individual would have a better chance of avoiding information leaks that hackers can exploit. Information and knowledge are just half the battle for all things that is why they are so invaluable.
